In level 0 we are already given password bandit0 and was said that to go to the next level (which is level 1)  and the password it was in readme file which is already present so just have to login in it and do cat readme and you get your password then exit.
In level 1-2 the password for next level is stored in – file which can be access by writing command cat  ./-  
In level 2-3 for getting password you have to use tab for showing that the file name has spaces in it
In this level 3-4 you have to go inside a directory and find a file name hidden which is a dot file and can be access by writing .filename
In this level 5-6 we have to write find .  -type f  |  xargs   and which ever file is readable access it , i find a commond on google by writing command to access human readable file xargs which covert some statement into command , one of it use we can access human readable file with it.
In the level 6-7 , I first use the command of last level find . type f for human readable and also to specify other properties of file we have to specify the size of the file for which I search on google and their I find a direct command – size1033c c for bytes and then for non executable just write ! executable , ! act as not as in coding. 
In the level 7-8, I take help of the suggested command given by the site grep I write on terminal man grep and study about it and first convert data.txt into strings by writing strings data.txt and the use strings data.txt | grep “millionth” for getting text next to some word.
In the level 8-9, I take help of the suggested commond sort and sort the string file data.txt in aliphatic order and then I could count which repeats one but there also given another commond uniq which I find out about by writing on terminal man uniq and find first line -c for count which give count of repeated line and use sort data.txt | uniq -c
In the level 9-10,  I use the last level commond and get all strings which are preceded by = and then check the one string manualy which seems like password by writing commond strings data.txt | grep “=”
In the level 10-11, I take help of commond base64 by writing man base64 and find on first line the commond of decode -d and write base64 -d data.txt
In the level 11-12, use commond tr which I find use on google and get idea from suggested commond and use commond  cat data.txt | tr “A-Za-z” “N-ZA-Mn-za-m”
In the level 12-13, write commond   mkdir  /tmp/raj123 then cp data.txt /tmp/raj123 then cat data.txt | xxd -r > data then file data then mv data data2.gz then gzip -d data2.gz and like this we will keep checking the file and modify the suffix and then again decompress the file. And then we get the type of file as ascii text print the content to get the password. 
In the level 13-14, I take help of wikipidea to get know about ssh and write ssh -I sshkey.private bandit14@localhost . which take me in bandit14 file and then I use ls commond to get known about file it contain and it contain only one and I access it as it was writtin in site cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 
In the level 14-15, write nc localhost 3000 and then correct ! we get our password BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr.
