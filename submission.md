### level 0 - level1 pass: NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL

	   found that commands like cat, more, vi etc can be used to open a file.

### level 1 - level2 pass: rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi

	   got to know how to open dashed named files using "cat ./-"

### level 2 - level3 pass: aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG

	   googled how to open file which has spaces in its name. We use double quotes in the file
	   name. like cat "spaces in this fileame"

### level 3 - level4 pass: 2EW7BBsr6aMMoJ2HjW067dm8EgX26xNe

	   learned about how to see/list all the hidden files in a directory using ls -a.
	   Opening a hidden file is same as opening any other normal file. Only differnce is that 
	   we need to use special methods to know their name. 

### level 4 - level5 pass: lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR

	   This level was trivial. Just opened each file and checked if I could understand
	   what's written in it. if I could, it is human-readable so just copy the password! 

### level 5 - level6 pass: P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU

	   This step took time. inhere directory had 19 daughter directories which inturn had 6 
	   visible and 2 hidden files.
	
	   Learned about commands du, find, ls and how to use them to know the size.
	   ls -l gives size of all the visible files in that directory
	   ls -al gives the size of all(including the hidden files) in the directory.
	
	   Atfirst I missed the fact that the directory can have hidden files. Then later I 
	   realized that there can be hidden files.
	
### level 6 - level 7 pass : z7WtoNQU2XfjmMtWA8u5rN4vzqu4v99S

	   we use --text attribute with grep.
	
### level 10 - level 11 pass : 6zPeziLdR2RKNdNYFNb6nVCKzphlXHBM

	   Learnt about the base64 encoding in linux. We can have 4 options:
