For creating catkin workspace we go to terminal and create the new catkin workspace using catkin_make . 1. mkdir -p/catkin_ws/src   2.  cd -/catkin_ws/   3.  catkin_make

Then we source it by writing on terminal source devel/setup.bash
Then we create a new package named math by writing on terminal 1. cd -/catkin_ws/src  to get into 2. catkin_create_pkg math rospy
Then we create a node directory within math package to store ros nodes by writing 1. cd ~/catkin_ws/src/math 2. mkdir nodes
Then  we Create the first ROS node named "input_node.py" inside the "nodes" directory by writing
Touch nodes/input_node.py
Now open node input_node.py in pycharm and write code in it 
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import Int32

rospy.init_node('input_node')

pub1 = rospy.Publisher('number1', Int32, queue_size=10)
pub2 = rospy.Publisher('number2', Int32, queue_size=10)

rate = rospy.Rate(1)  # Publish rate in Hz

while not rospy.is_shutdown():
    number1 = 42  # Replace with your random number generation logic
    number2 = 17  # Replace with your random number generation logic

    pub1.publish(number1)
    pub2.publish(number2)

    rate.sleep()
create second ros node named output_node.py inside nodes directory by writing touch nodes/output_nodes.py now open this in pycharm and write in it
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import Int32
from math.srv import AddTwoNumbers, AddTwoNumbersResponse

rospy.init_node('output_node')

sum_pub = rospy.Publisher('sum', Int32, queue_size=10)

def add_two_numbers(request):
    sum_result = request.number1 + request.number2

    sum_pub.publish(sum_result)

    return AddTwoNumbersResponse(sum_result)
    rospy.Service('add_two_numbers', AddTwoNumbers, add_two_numbers)

rospy.spin()
now create srv directory within math package to store the service definition file by writing 1. mkdir srv then create a new file named addtwonumbers.srv  inside srv by writing touch srv/addtwonumbers.srv
then open this in pycharm and write 
int32 number1
int32 number2
int32 sum
go in catkinworkspace by writing 1.cd -/catkin_ws and write 2.catkin_make to save all the changes in workspace.
